profiling:  # This is an example of how we would write YAML for the profiler
  targets:  # These are example run configurations (just arguments)
    - {args: "-interval 1 --use-gpu", timeout: 120}  # This is one config
    - {args: "--use-gpu", timeout: 60}  # This might be a more performance-intense config
    - {args: "--use-cpu", timeout: 0}  # This might be a config that only uses CPU and has no timeout (it relies on the app to close on its own)
  metrics: ['system', 'gpu-summary']  # This is where the developer specifies which external metrics to gather
  

testing:
  mask_entrypoint: true  # this is usually required (to mask ENTRYPOINT defined in Dockerfile)
  command: ["echo", "test is successful"]
